                Web applications are easily accessible to hackers. They are also a lucrative attack target because they often store valuable data such as credit card numbers, personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data. Most Web applications – over 80% – have had high, critical, or urgent vulnerabilities. This is due in part to the lack of effort applied to secure coding; most developers are motivated to write code quickly or create new functionality rather than to develop secure applications.

            <h5 class="fw-light lh-base" style="text-align: justify;">
                To overcome, prevent or at least reduce the risk of being attacked, a tool has been developed to scan code flawed and possible code injections in order to prevent future attack from attackers.

                The <span class="px-2 fw-bold bg-success">Source Code Analysis Tool</span> provides detail insight on code flaws uploaded by user to the system in order to fix and explain in details of the OWASP Vulnerabilities in the code. In this project, there will be two module which is the manage code analysis and manage analytic report.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="fw-light lh-base" style="text-align: justify;">
                The tool can provide insight on the code flaw found and detailed analysis on the code whereabout and prevention method and technique. Furthermore, this tool uses an updatable database dictionary to provide clear usage on the code analysis that being made. The tools help summarised all details on the code flawed on which lines, causes, fix and explanation. The tools show total number of threat or possible code flawed and then will be display on a page and can be downloaded as pdf for personal references.
