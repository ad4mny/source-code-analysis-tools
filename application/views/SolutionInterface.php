                Nowadays, web application security is a must to fulfil a development needs which can be seen as a major setback without it. The evolving attacks and malicious tools and way to take down a system completely has been a threat to developers and clients. Code flaws has been the main reason for the attacks. These flawed must be curb before the system has been staged in the live server which effects would catastrophic if there is no fixture.
